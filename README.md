# guessing_game
Description: The program guessinggame.sh is a bash script that does the following:
The script continuously asks the user to guess the number of files in the current directory, until they guess the correct number. 
If they guess is wrong the script informs the user wether their guess is lower or higher than the answer.
Once the user guesses the correct number of files in the current directory they are congratulated.
